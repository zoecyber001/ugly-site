    WARNING PAGE
    ============
    
    This is the ONLY sane page on this entire website.
    Cherish it. Hold it close. It's all downhill from here.
    
    No animations. No flashing. No Comic Sans.
    Just a honest warning about the chaos that awaits.
    
    Think of this as the calm before the storm.
    The last normal thing you'll see for a while.
    
    Turn back now. There's still time.
    ...
    You're still here? Okay, your funeral.
